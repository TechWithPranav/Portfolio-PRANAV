**********HOC **********
hoc : higher order componenent...........

- just consider a scenario that our web app we want al all our component in center right
- so styling each component is not good practice right
- so what we can do we can create a HOC and in that we wrap our alll componenents so that all components will come inside this
- it is very easy just understand the flow..............
- we just need to export a component and its Id for ex abt
- then that we have to use in hoc - > SectionWrapper.jsx
